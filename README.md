# Please Note

This script no longer works since the NYT has bought the rights to the game. It was able to work originally due to the Wordle dictionary being stored in a client side JavaScript array
and the solutions for any given day simply corresponding to increasing your index in the array. I had set it up on a random Oracle VM and ran SSH via iOS shortcuts to cd into the
project directory and simply run the Java program which is hosted here.
